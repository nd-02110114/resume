### Quantum chemical simulation (chemistry)

My B.E. research interest was analysis of the electrochemical reaction by using a quantum chemical simulation. So, I get used to using the following libraries.

- Gaussian, VASP, Quantum Espresso

### Front-End Development

While my major is chemistry, I am self-taught in programming and has more than two years of web application development experience through internships at several companies. In particular, we have extensive experience in developing web applications based on React and Typescript. I also have a basic knowledge of multi-person development flows, including CI and deployment.  
Recently, I've been interested in AST (abstract syntax tree) of JS, and I made a babel plugin by myself ([babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse](https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse)).

### Machine Learning and Data Analysis

My M.S. research field is [Materials Informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_informatics). Specifically, I'm interested in applying graph convolutional neural networks to designing new inorganic crystals. I am familiar with general machine learning and data analysis methods, as well as deep generative models based on Bayesian theory. Also, I have experiences about tabular data analysis related to Kaggle or a company.

## Works

<hr />

### Goofi Mobile

link : [https://github.com/nd-02110114/goofi-mobile](https://github.com/nd-02110114/goofi-mobile)

Mobile app for searching good first issues in OSS.  
I created this app to understand Expo(React Native), Apollo Client, Atomic Design and GraphQL.

### Babel plugin object to json parse

link : [https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse](https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse)

This babel plugin converts object literal to JSON.parse and inspired by [V8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json).  
Mathias Bynens introduced this plugin at ChromeDevSummit 2019.

## OSS

<hr />

### React Native : [PRs](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3And-02110114+is%3Aclosed)

I sent many PRs to Good First Issues.  
My tasks were cleaning legacy codes, strengthening type definitions and so on.

### js-primer (online book for JS beginners) : [PRs](https://github.com/asciidwango/js-primer/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3And-02110114+is%3Aclosed)

I integrated PWA in this app and it allow you to view the js-primer offline.

### Chainer Chemistry : [PR](https://github.com/chainer/chainer-chemistry/pull/405)

I implemented graph convolutional neural network model for inorganic crystal. As a result, it is now possible to analyze not only organic molecular systems but also inorganic crystal systems, expanding the scope of the library's application.
