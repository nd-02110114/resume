## Educations

### Waseda University, Japan

- 2015.4 - 2019.3 : B.E. in Applied Chemistry

### University of Tokyo, Japan

- 2019.4 - 2021.3 (expected) : M.S. in Chemical System Engineering

## Skills

### Language

- Japanese: native
- English: intermediate ([CEFR](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions) : B1)

### Quantum chemical simulation (chemistry)

My B.E. research interest was analysis of the electrochemical reaction by using a quantum chemical simulation.  
So, I get used to using the following libraries.

- Gaussian, VASP, Quantum Espresso

### Programming Languages

- JavaScript
  - TypeScript, Flowtype, jQuery
  - React, React Native
  - Babel, Webpack
  - Node.js
- Python
  - Pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Tensorflow, Pytorch, Chainer
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL
- Ruby

### Front-End Development

I have +2 years experiences about developing applications based on React and Typescript. I have knowledges of typical developing workflow, GitHub issue, CI, and deployment. I also have experience of applications using not the latest libraries (ex : jQuery or Flowtype).  
Recently, I'm interested in AST(abstract syntax tree) and have created the babel plugin ([link](https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse)).

### Machine Learning and Data Analysis

My M.S. research field is [Materials Informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_informatics). Specifically, I'm interested in applying graph convolutional neural networks to designing  inorganic crystals. I have knowledges of machine learning, data analysis and, deep generative models (bayesian knowledge). Also, I have experiences about tabular data analysis related to kaggle and a company.

## Works

### Goofi Mobile

link : https://github.com/nd-02110114/goofi-mobile

Mobile app for searching good first issues in OSS.  
I created this app to understand Expo(React Native), Apollo Client, Atomic Design and GraphQL.

### Babel plugin object to json parse

link : https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse

This babel plugin converts object literal to JSON.parse and inspired by [V8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json).  
Mathias Bynens introduced this plugin at ChromeDevSummit 2019.

## OSS

### React Native : [PRs](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3And-02110114+is%3Aclosed)

I sent many PRs to Good First Issues.  
My tasks were cleaning legacy codes, strengthening type definitions and so on.

### js-primer (online book for JS beginners) : [PRs](https://github.com/asciidwango/js-primer/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3And-02110114+is%3Aclosed)

I integrated PWA in this app and offline access enabled.

### Chainer Chemistry : [PR](https://github.com/chainer/chainer-chemistry/pull/405)

I implemented graph convolutional neural network model for inorganic crystal.
